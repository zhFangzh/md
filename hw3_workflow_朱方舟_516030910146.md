****#Git Workflow>**Git Workflows** are designed to be guidelines rather than concrete rules. ##What is a successful Git Workflow>* Does this workflow scale with project size >* Is it easy to undo mistakes and errors with this workflow?>* Does this workflow impose any new unnecessary cognitive overhead to you?##Why do we use these Git Workflow> A **Git Workflow** is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. It will be useful for both ourselves and our team to choose a good fit when we start a project.##Centralized Workflow>Like Subversion, the **Centralized Workflow** uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project. Instead of *trunk*, the default development branch is called *master* and all changes are committed into this branch. This workflow doesn’t require any other branches besides *master*.##How it works+ **Initialize the central repository**>1. create the central repository on a server>2. initialize an empty repository or import an existing Git or SVN repository.+ **Hosted central repositories**>Central repositories are often created through 3rd party Git hosting services like [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org/product) or [Bitbucket Server](https://bitbucket.org/product/enterprise). The process of initializing a bare repository discussed above is handled for you by the hosting service. The hosting service will then provide an address for the central repository to access from your local repository.+ **Clone the central repository**>Each developer creates a local copy of the entire project. 	git clone ssh://user@host/path/to/repo.git+ **Make changes and commit**	>Once the repository is cloned locally, a developer can make changes using the standard Git commit process: edit, stage, and commit.  	git clone ssh://user@host/path/to/repo.git	git status # View the state of the repo	git add <some-file> # Stage a file	git commit # Commit a file</some-file>+ **Push new commits to central repository**>Once the local repository has new changes committed. These change will need to be pushed to share with other developers on the project.	git push origin master+ **Managing conflicts**>The central repository represents the official project, so its commit history should be treated as sacred and immutable. If a developer’s local commits diverge from the central repository, Git will refuse to push their changes because this would overwrite official commits.
